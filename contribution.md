Quinn developed the initial skeleton of the project, beginning with target validation to ensure it was both valid and active. She also implemented the connect scan functionality. Malaz contributed the SYN scan, refined the main function, and tested the output using a known target. Michelle implemented the UDP scan and handled the multithreading logic. She was also responsible for writing the project documentation.
